A Pokemon battle game 

The biggest shortcoming of tmy game is that i did npt figure out how to append the element ID to either defender or player area depending on when the user clicked on the pokemon

and the attack buttons are set to only attack one pokemon from a predetermined pokemon so as of right now the entirer game is predetermined and the selector area has no purpose. 

the game does alert the user when a pokemon is KO'd and sets the value of the KO'd pokemon to null thereby removing it from the page
