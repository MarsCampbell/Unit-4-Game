# Unit-4-Game

A Pokemon Game

the code is excessive and repetitive and I am well aware that there is probably a much more elegant solution but it does work

1. first pokemon clicked goes into the playerArea
2. second pokemon clicked goes into the defenderArea
3. only when there is a pokemon in each area can the attack button work
4. attack increases by base on each click
5. each attack is met with a counter attack
6. mewtwo only appears in the defenderArea once all enemies are defeated
7. when mewtwo is efeated an alert announces the players victory
